<h2 align= "center"> Cosine_Similarity</h2>

* Cosine Similarity is a measurement that quantifies the similarity between two or more vectors. 
* The cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between vectors. 
* The vectors are typically non-zero and are within an inner product space.

* Cosine Similarity is a value that is bound by a constrained range of 0 and 1.
* The similarity measurement is a measure of the cosine of the angle between the two non-zero vectors A and B.
